Issue 580:	OS X Kernel UaF in hypervisor driver

The hv_space lock group gets an extra ref dropped when you kill a process with an AppleHV userclient;
one via IOService::terminateWorker calling the AppleHVClient::free method (which calls lck_rw_free on the 
lock group using the pointer hanging off the global _hv variable) and secondly via the hypervisor
machine_thread_destroy callback (hv_callback_thread_destroy) which also calls lck_rw_free with a lock group
pointer taken from _hv.

tested on OS X 10.11 ElCapitan (15a284) on MacBookAir 5,2

CVE-2015-7078
