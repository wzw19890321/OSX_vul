iOS/MacOS kernel UaF due to lack of locking in host_self_trap

The task struct has a lock (itk_lock_data, taken via the itk_lock macros) which is supposed to
protect the task->itk_* ports.

The host_self_trap mach trap accesses task->itk_host without taking this lock leading to a use-after-free
given the following interleaving of execution:

Thread A: host_self_trap:
  read current_task()->itk_host         // Thread A reads itk_host

Thread B: task_set_special_port:
  *whichp = port;                       // Thread B replaces itk_host with eg MACH_PORT_NULL
  itk_unlock(task);
  
  if (IP_VALID(old))
    ipc_port_release_send(old);         // Thread B drops last ref on itk_host

Thread A: host_self_trap:
  passes the port to ipc_port_copy_send // uses the free'd port

host_self_trap should use one of the canonical accessors for the task's host port, not just directly read it.
